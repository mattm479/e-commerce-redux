  ## Description
  This project utilized Redux for it's state. We were given a running application using React's Context API and had to refactor it using Redux. This turned out to be quite challenging as we had not learned about Redux during class and there were multiple ways to do the refactor. Ultimately, I decided to use redux-toolkit as recommended in the Redux documentation but this method is fairly new so the documentation was not as fleshed out as some of the other ways of achieving this. Once I learned how the toolkit worked however, the majority of the refactor went pretty smoothly. I did have an issue where the update cart quantity reducer didn't want me to change the product in the cart's state so I had to make a new array to get it to work. Overall, this was a fun project that taught us a new technology to use in the future.
